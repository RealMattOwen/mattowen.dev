Computer hardware fanatic turned self-taught front-end engineer. My passion for technology has grown greatly since 2014 when I first began exploring computer hardware and software. I started focusing on front-end web development towards the end of 2016 because of some modules in the college course I was enrolled in at the time. After a lot of hard work I was able to secure my first software development job as a Junior React Engineer, at [Mindera UK](https://mindera.com/) in September 2018, where I am still currently working alongside many other very talented techies and non-techies that are all keen to share their knowledge and experience. Some other interests I have are PC and console gaming and listening to EDM and rap music.
